We will notify of the changes where required by applicable law to do so.Last modified on June 18, 2018.General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)The General Data Protection Regulation, known as GDPR, was approved by the European Union in April 2016 and is in effect as on May 25, 2018. It is the most sweeping legislation in the last two decades focused on data security and privacy, and significantly updates, extends, and harmonises data protection legislation across the EU/EEA.To read more about GDPR, please click here.Who is subject to GDPR?Individuals, organisations and companies that control or process personal data are subject to GDPR. In broad terms, there are three different actors:Data subjects (students, families, school employees)Data controllers (the school)Data processors (system like AssessPrep)As a data processor, we do not decide the purpose or lawfulness of the data we process and store. We are trustees acting on our customers’ behalf. As data controllers, schools remain ultimately responsible for documenting and deciding how data enters our systems. However, GDPR regulations do impose new and stricter regulations on processors. We will fully comply with these requirements for all of our services, including AssessPrep and Integration partners.How is GDPR different from current data protection laws?Key areas of difference center on increased accountability for companies, greater access to personal data for individuals, and higher penalties for non-compliance.GDPR explicitly lays out key rights of data subjects:right to be informedright of rectificationright of erasureright to restrict processingright of data portabilityright to objectright of accessThese rights form the framework for interactions between the data subject, controller, and processor. While the controller (school) remains responsible for respecting these rights, the processor (us) may assist in accomplishing these tasks.The penalties for non-compliance are not insubstantial. A school found in violation of GDPR may be assessed fines worth up to 4% of total annual revenue. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is responsible for enforcing GDPR and has a broad range of powers to do so.What kind of data is covered, and what information are schools allowed to collect?All personal data concerning an individual (data subject) is included under GDPR. Specifically, personal data that allows an individual to be identified — for example name, address, phone number, photo, etc. — is included under GDPR.Even if personal data has been encrypted, pseudonymised, or anonymized, it may still fall under the scope of GDPR if the data can still be used to identify a specific individual.Examples of personal data that our schools collect and store includes:NamesAddressesE-mail AddressesPhone NumbersID Numbers (Passport, National Id, SSN)GDPR specifies six lawful bases for collecting personal data:ConsentWritten contractLegal ObligationVital InterestsPublic tasksLegitimate interestsFor most schools, the legal basis for data collection relates to either legal obligations as learning institutions, or to legitimate interests.Most of the bases require that the data processing is necessary, i.e. if you can reasonably achieve the same results and purpose without processing data, then you do not have a lawful basis.Is AssessPrep GDPR-compliant?We are as of May 25, 2018. We are well prepared for the GDPR changes with a strong set of organisational and technical security measures. AssessPrep has been designed from the start with personal data protection in mind, and we pride ourselves on offering schools, students, and parents the highest level of security.As a part of our commitment to GDPR, you can expect AssessPrep to:Ensure organisational and technical security for all services.Assist with documentation to demonstrate compliance and keep users informed.Provide new contract addenda that comply with GDPR requirements for Data Processing Agreements (DPA)Offer support when your users exercise their data subject rights.We continue to invest in organisational security, network and infrastructure security, and application security to ensure we can offer world-class security beyond standard requirements. We are careful not to provide explicit detail about our security measures but our standard protocols include:Application security: traffic encryption, strongly hashed passwords, safeguards against vulnerabilities such as cross site scripting, SQL injections, phishing and others.Network security: firewalls and systems to detect suspicious behaviour, stop malicious attempts to gain access, or compromise the resilience of the service (e.g. DDOS attacks).Organisational security: access policies, audit logs and confidentiality agreements.Physical security: preventing unauthorized access to infrastructure processing personal data.Procedural security: IT management processes to minimize the risk of human errors, or testing regimes to identify software weaknesses before releasing new features to our cloud services, or policies to ensure data is only processed on instruction from our customers.How does AssessPrep obtain personal data about users, and how is it used?User data is submitted to our platforms in three ways:1. directly by the users2. by representatives authorised by the users (e.g. the school technology director obtains data and then uploads it to our platform)3. via an integration with a third-party systemData typically enters our systems via “student information systems” independently maintained and controlled by our customer schools. We import data from third-party systems only under direct instruction from our customers.We use personal data under our protection only when we receive direct instructions from the customer school. The data stored on our systems belongs directly our customers, and only a handful of AssessPrep staff have access to personal data under strict confidentiality and security. We process personal data independently only if it is vital to the integrity or security of the service, or to analyze or evaluate the quality of the service provided.Can any of our users request data deletion under the “right to be forgotten”?Likely not. A data deletion request is valid only if the lawful basis of the processing is Consent (see above), or if the original purpose is no longer valid.We strongly recommend that our schools implement clear processes for evaluating these kinds of requests. Our Data Protection Officer can also assist with advice in difficult cases. If a data subject is granted the right to be deleted, AssessPrep will, either through our software or our support services, help execute these rights and confirm the deletion.When does AssessPrep delete personal data?AssessPrep deletes personal data when instructed by our customers, or if the contract between us and the customer is terminated. The procedures around deleting customer data upon termination of service should be provided in writing or in a Data Processor Agreement.An instruction to delete a user in our services can either be manually performed in the platform by a customer representative or upon request to our support team.When users are deleted in our systems, there are safeguards in place to prevent errors leading to an irreplaceable loss of data. In many cases customers will have to manually confirm the deletion of customer data, including personal data.Can a user contact AssessPrep directly (e.g. student, parent, teacher) to exercise his rights under GDPR?No. Under GDPR, the data subject (user) rights is between him and the controller (our customers). Any data subject requests from end users to AssessPrep will be handed over to the customer. AssessPrep will cooperate in good faith with customers to ensure they can exercise the rights of the data subjects in a prompt manner.Will AssessPrep notify users if a data breach has occurred?Depending on the nature of the data breach, our customers might be required to promptly notify both the users affected and the supervising authorities. AssessPrep is required to notify its customers when becoming aware of a data breach, and to help them in fulfill obligations in notifying users.Does GDPR impact customers outside the EU?Not legally. The EU, obviously, has no legislative power over other jurisdictions. GDPR does not offer any rights or freedoms to data subjects located outside the EU, and does not put obligations on non-EU customers that do not process data on EU/EEA data subjects.However, AssessPrep offers, for the most part, the same services and same level of security to all our customers. In other words, no matter where your school is located, you will benefit from our approach to security of personal data under GDPR.Who do I contact with further questions?For general questions related to AssessPrep you can always contact our support team at support@assessprep.com.For specific GDPR-related questions from our customers, please contact our Data Protection Officer Abhimanyu Jhajharia at info@assessprep.com.
